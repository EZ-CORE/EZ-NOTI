3. **App Active**: Shows in-app notification → can navigate to deep link page

## 🎉 Success Indicators

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**No FCM Token?**
- Check Firebase config files are in correct locations
- Verify app runs on physical device (not all emulators work)
- Check console for permission errors

**Notifications Not Received?**
- Verify Firebase project setup
- Check service account key is valid
- Test with different notification priorities

**Deep Links Not Working?**
- Check app routing configuration
- Verify deep link paths match your routes
- Test navigation manually first

**Server Connection Failed?**
- Check Firebase service account key path
- Verify JSON file is valid and has correct permissions

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Customize notification templates** in the server
2. **Add user authentication** to associate tokens with users
3. **Implement notification preferences** (allow users to opt out)
